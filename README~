This following project consists of 4 different programs that do the same thing; that is find the longest common subsequence.
The four programs starting in order of highest execution times asymptotically begin with naive recursive, with memoization, dynamic programming and lastly implementing the Hirschberg algorithm to implement the same.
Each of the program has the object file and the executable separate so just doing a "./ hirschberg.out > lcs_hirschberg_output.txt" on the bash shell acheives the result.
To create the random input string input one of only binary string that is in file binary_seq_input_long.txt and one with characters that is in text file dna_input_long.txt, used the program random_input_text.cpp
